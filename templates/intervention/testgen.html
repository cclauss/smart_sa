Feature: Autogenerated Run-Through

Run through the entire intervention. This test is generated from the
content in the database. Hopefully, this will help us keep 
up to date with changing content. To create this, I run a 
pull_from_prod to the test instance, then run a dev server
on port 8001 with the settings_test and do
curl http://localhost:8001/testgen/ > intervention/features/auto_runthrough.feature
Don't edit this feature file directly. Edit templates/intervention/testgen.html instead

    Scenario: Automated Run-Through
      Using selenium
      Given I am logged in as a counselor
      When I access the url "/"
      When I click the "Let's get started!" link
      When I click the "Intervene" link
      When I fill in "test" in the "name" form field
      When I fill in "test" in the "id_number" form field
      When I submit the "login-participant-form" form
      Then I am on the Intervention page

{% for intervention in interventions %}
   {% for session in intervention.clientsession_set.all %}
      ## SESSION {{session.index}}

      When I click on Session {{session.index}}

      {% for activity in session.activity_set.all %}
      When I click on Activity {{activity.index}}
      Then I am on the Activity {{activity.index}} page
      {% if activity.game %}
      When I click the "Next" link
      Then there is a game
      # TODO: handle tests on individual games
      {% endif %}
      When I click on Session {{session.index}}
      {% endfor %}
   {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
      Finished using selenium
