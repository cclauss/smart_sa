Windows Installation
====================

* Install Python 2.7 (assuming to C:\Python27)
* Install setuptools
* Install PIL (TODO: eliminate this dependency)
* Download http://behemoth.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/masivukeni.zip (will move
that later)
* extract it
* open terminal, navigate to smart_sa directory that was extracted
* run
    C:\Python27\lib\scripts\easy_install.exe pip
    C:\Python27\lib\scripts\pip.exe install --requirement=requirements/windows.txt
    C:\Python27\python.exe manage.py syncdb --settings=settings_windows
    C:\Python27\python.exe manage.py migrate --settings=settings_windows
    C:\Python27\python.exe manage.py pull_from_prod --settings=settings_windows
    C:\Python27\python.exe manage.py runserver --settings=settings_windows
* open browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Things to look into
-------------------

* simplejson complains about lack of C compiler (but works). worth
  fixing?
* how to run without terminal, started from a shortcut [solved: use .pyw extension]
* how to detect existing running instance
* media paths (where to store video)
* techniques for capturing logs in a format that could be emailed to
  us for remote debugging
* py2exe build?
* how to install setuptools without network access

TODO: 

* set South Africa timezone in config
* when running in "clinic" mode, we probably want a different front page (hidden admin login, etc).
* clear out all email related stuff from clinic settings.py
