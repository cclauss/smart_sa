<h1>Update procedure for 2012-11-07 update</h1>

<p>After minimizing or closing any windows that are open, put in the
	USB key with the update files. Select "Open folder to view
	files":</p>

<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/update-2012-11-07/01.png" />

<p>double click on the "2012-11-07-update" folder</p>

<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/update-2012-11-07/02.png" />

<p>It should look something like this (I may have forgotten a file or
	two here, but it should be close):</p>

<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/update-2012-11-07/03.png" />

<p>Leave this window open and open up another explorer window
	alongside it by going to Start -> Documents. Arrange things so you
	can see both windows at the same time. In the new one, double click
	on "Local Disk (C:)" in the left-hand menu, then on
	"smart_sa". I'll refer to this window as the "C:" window from now
	on and the other window as the USB drive.</p>

		 />

<p>The directory listing should look something like this:</p>

<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/update-2012-11-07/05.png"
		 />

<p>Double-click "uploads" and then "video". From the USB drive, select
	all the MP4 Video files (you can do them all at once with
	Control+click or just do them one at a time), and drag them onto the
	"C:" window.</p>

<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/update-2012-11-07/06.png"
		 />

<p>Use the back button on the "C:" window to go back to the "smart_sa"
	directory listing, then double-click down through "media" and
	"css". Select the "print.css" file from the USB drive and drag it
	into the "C:" folder, selecting "Copy and Replace" when prompted.</p>

<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/update-2012-11-07/07.png"
		 />

<p>Back up to the "smart_sa" directory listing again and click down
	through "templates" and "intervention". Drag "activity.html" over
	from the USB drive, again selecting "Copy and Replace".</p>

<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/update-2012-11-07/08.png"
		 />

<p>Finally, back up to the "smart_sa" directory and then down through
	"watchvideo_game", "templates", "watchvideo_game", and drag
	"video.html" over from the USB drive, again selecting "Copy and
	Replace".</p>

<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/update-2012-11-07/09.png" />

<p>You should probably be done now. You might want to go back to the
	browser, login, go into practice mode and navigate to the pages with
	the videos to just double check that they got copied in to the right
	place.</p>
