<h1>Update procedure for 2012-11-07 code/video update</h1>

<h2>Preparation</h2>

<p>The first step is to prepare the USB thumb drive that you will be
	using to distribute the updates to the laptops.</p>

<p>For this you will need a computer with an internet connection and a
	copy of WinZip installed. You can download a free version of WinZip
	from <a href="http://www.winzip.com/win/en/index.htm">here</a> if
	you don't already have it. Follow their instructions for installing
	it on your computer.</p>

<p>Next, you need to download the zip file with the code updates. You
	can get it
	from: <a href="http://behemoth.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/2012-11-07-update.zip">http://behemoth.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/2012-11-07-update.zip</a>. Save
	it on your desktop or somewhere that's easy to find.</p>

<p>Make sure your USB drive is in and take note of what drive your
	computer mounted it as. Probably, "E:" </p>

<p>Right click on the zip file you just downloaded and select "Extract
	to..." Select the USB drive. Winzip's interface is terrible
	and confusing. I'm sorry. I don't know of anything better
	though. Ideally, Winzip will create a folder called
	"2012-11-07-update" on the USB drive with a half dozen or so files
	in it. You may find yourself instead with that folder created and
	then a second "2012-11-07-update" folder inside of that one, or you
	may find that it has just dumped the individual files at the top
	level on the USB drive. In the former case, the easiest thing to do
	is just make note of that and keep that in mind in the following
	steps, navigating down through the extraneous folder. In the latter
	case, it's probably best to just manually make a folder on the USB
	drive named "2012-11-07-update" and drag the files into it.</p>

<p>Make sure that all the copying to the USB drive has completed (it
	could take a couple minutes since there are some large video
	files). Then you should be able to take it out of the computer.</p>

<h2>Update Procedure</h2>

<p><i>This is the part that you will do on each laptop.</i></p>


<p>After minimizing or closing any windows that are open, put in the
	USB key with the update files. Select "Open folder to view
	files":</p>

<p>double click on the "2012-11-07-update" folder</p>

<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/update-2012-11-07/02.png" />

<p>It should look something like this (I may have forgotten a file or
	two here, but it should be close):</p>

<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/update-2012-11-07/03.png" />

<p>Leave this window open and open up another explorer window
	alongside it by going to Start -> Documents. Arrange things so you
	can see both windows at the same time. In the new one, double click
	on "Local Disk (C:)" in the left-hand menu, then on
	"smart_sa". I'll refer to this window as the "C:" window from now
	on and the other window as the USB drive.</p>

		 />

<p>The directory listing should look something like this:</p>

<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/update-2012-11-07/05.png"
		 />

<p>Double-click "uploads" and then "video". From the USB drive, select
	all the MP4 Video files (you can do them all at once with
	Control+click or just do them one at a time), and drag them onto the
	"C:" window.</p>

<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/update-2012-11-07/06.png"
		 />

<p>Use the back button on the "C:" window to go back to the "smart_sa"
	directory listing, then double-click down through "media" and
	"css". Select the "print.css" file from the USB drive and drag it
	into the "C:" folder, selecting "Copy and Replace" when prompted.</p>

<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/update-2012-11-07/07.png"
		 />

<p>Back up to the "smart_sa" directory listing again and click down
	through "templates" and "intervention". Drag "activity.html" over
	from the USB drive, again selecting "Copy and Replace".</p>

<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/update-2012-11-07/08.png"
		 />

<p>Finally, back up to the "smart_sa" directory and then down through
	"watchvideo_game", "templates", "watchvideo_game", and drag
	"video.html" over from the USB drive, again selecting "Copy and
	Replace".</p>

<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/update-2012-11-07/09.png" />

<p>You should probably be done now. You might want to go back to the
	browser, login, go into practice mode and navigate to the pages with
	the videos to just double check that they got copied in to the right
	place.</p>
