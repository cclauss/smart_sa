<h1>Content Update Instructions</h1>

<h2>Download New Content</h2>

<p>You will need a computer with an internet connection (probably the
	one that you're reading this on right now) and a USB thumb
	drive. Make sure the USB drive is plugged in and you know what drive
	letter the computer has given it (usually "E:"). </p>

<p>If we have prepared a download for you specifically, just download
	the zip from the link we have provided and place it on the thumb
	drive. Then go ahead to the next section which describes installing
	the new content on the laptops from the thumb drive.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the current site content is
	available <a href="http://masivukeni2.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/intervention_admin/zip_download/">here</a>. When
	you click that link, you will be prompted to download and save a zip
	file with a name something like
	"masivukeni-2012-11-07T15-57-21.zip". (but the current date/time in
	the filename instead). Save it to the thumb drive and go on to the
	next section.</p>

<h2>Installing New Content on the Laptops</h2>

<p>This is the part that you will do on each laptop. You need the USB
	drive with the content zip on it that you downloaded in the previous
	section.</p>

<p>Insert the drive into the laptop. It will prompt you for what to
	do:</p>

<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/update-2012-11-07/01.png" />

<p>Select "Open folder to view files". (Actually, this doesn't really
	matter. You just want to get rid of that dialog box and double check
	that the list of files looks like what you expect).</p>



<p>Go back to the web browser if it's still open, or start a new
	session by clicking the Chrome button on the taskbar. The Masivukeni
	site should be there. </p>



<p>Log into Masivukeni as 'admin'.</p>

<p>Click "Administrate"</p>
<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/content_update/02.png" />


<p>Click the "Update Intervention" tab (or just scroll all the way to
	the bottom of the page)</p>
<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/content_update/03.png" />

<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/content_update/04.png" />
<p>Click the "Choose File" button and select the zip file on the thumb
	drive</p>

<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/content_update/05.png" />





<p>Click the "Update Content" button.</p>

<p>It will take it a few seconds, but it should finish by saying
	"intervention content updated" like so:</p>

<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/content_update/06.png" />

<p>If you see anything else, take note of exactly what it says and
	report it back to us and we'll help you troubleshoot.</p>

<p>You may want to go through the practice mode and just double check
	that everything looks like it should.</p>
