		<h1>Time-Tracking Patch installation</h1>
		<h2>1) Get the patch</h2>

		<p>Get it
		from <a href="patch_timetracking_2013.zip">here</a>. Unzip it onto
		a USB key. It should result in a directory named
		"patch_timetracking_2013".</p>

		<h2>Copy on C:</h2>
		<p>Plug the USB key into the laptop, open it for browsing.</p>

		<p> Open
		another window and go to "C:".</p>

		<img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/update-2013-02-04/02.png" />

		<p>Copy the "patch_timetracking_2013"
		directory to C:</p>

		<h2>Install</h2>
		<p>Open up the newly copied "C:\\patch_timetracking_2013\"
		directory and double-click on "install". A terminal window should
		open up and some text should scroll by. Give it a few minutes to
		run.</p>

		<p>It will close the terminal window itself when it is
		finished.</p>

		<h2>Reboot and test</h2>

		<p>Reboot the computer. Log into the Masivukeni app as usual, and
		make sure it appears to be working as normal.</p>

		<p>At this point, it is safe to delete the
		"C:\\patch_timetracking_2013" directory (though not
		necessary).</p>
