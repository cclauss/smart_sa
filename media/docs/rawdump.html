		<h1>Raw Dump</h1>

		<p>In the <a href="timeout_patch.html">Timeout patch</a>, we've
			also included a new script to do a raw database dump. It's a
			little less automatic of a process and the data produced isn't as
			directly usable for us, but it should be fast and gives us raw
			data that we can use to reconstruct the full database back
			here.</p>

		<p>I recommend just moving it out of the "patch_timeout_2014" folder
			and putting at the top level on your USB drive for easy access.</p>

		<p>To run the script, just right click and "Run as
			administrator". It will prompt you for the database password, which
			should be set to just "masivukeni".</p>

		<p>Once it has run (it should only take a few seconds), if you look
			in your "C:\" drive, there should be a file there called
			"data_dump". </p>

		<p>You should copy that to your USB drive and rename it with the
			name of the clinic and date in the filename to keep things
			straight.</p>

		<p>We don't have an upload process set up for raw dumps, so just
		email them to CCNMTL.</p>
