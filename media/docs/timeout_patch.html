    <title>Masivukeni: installing timeout patch</title>

    <h1>Timeout Patch installation</h1>
    <h2>1) Get the patch</h2>

    <p>Get it
      from <a href="patch_timeout_2014.zip">here</a>. Unzip it onto
      a USB key. It should result in a directory named
      "patch_timeout_2014".</p>

    <h2>Copy on C:</h2>
    <p>Plug the USB key into the laptop, open it for
      browsing. Open up "C:" in another window and copy the
      "patch_timeout_2014" folder there.</p>

		<h2>Run installer</h2>
		<p>Go into the "C:\patch_timeout_2014\" folder, right
      click on the "install" file and select "Run as Administrator".</p>

      />

		<h2>Restart Webserver</h2>

		<p>Running that installer changed a config file for
      the webserver. Now it needs to be restarted for the
      change to take effect. This step is actually optional;
      you could instead just reboot the machine and will be
      fine. Doing it this way is a little faster though.</p>

		<p>Run the Bitnami Manager tool. You can find it under
      "Bitnami DjangoStack" in the start menu, or search for
      "Manager Tool". It will look like this:</p>

    <img src="/site_media/images/screenshots/update-2014-02-19/03.png"
         />

		<p>Select "Apache Web Server" and hit the "Restart"
      button on the right.</p>

		<p>That should do it. The webserver's timeout has now been changed
		from 5 minutes to 50 minutes, which ought to be long enough...</p>
